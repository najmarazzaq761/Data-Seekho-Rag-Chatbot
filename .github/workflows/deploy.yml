Here is the YAML with added comments:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    # This workflow is triggered on push events for the 'main' branch
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  # The CI/CD pipeline consists of three jobs: test, build, and deploy
  test:
    # This is the test job, which runs on an ubuntu-latest environment
    name: Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      PYTEST_ADDOPTS: '--junit-xml=reports/junit.xml'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code  # Checkout the code in the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies  # Install dependencies using pip
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests  # Run tests using pytest
        run: |
          pytest
      - name: Publish test results  # Publish test results in JUnit format
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v3
        with:
          metadata: github/actions/junit

  build:
    # This is the build job, which runs on an ubuntu-latest environment
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      PYRAMID_ENV: production
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code  # Checkout the code in the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies  # Install dependencies using pip
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Build and train model  # Build and train the Rasa model using `python -m rasa train`
        run: |
          python -m rasa train

  deploy:
    # This is the deploy job, which runs on an ubuntu-latest environment
    name: Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      # Replace with your actual API key and secret
      REACT_APP_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_API_KEY }}
      REACT_APP_API_SECRET: ${{ secrets.REACT_APP_API_SECRET }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code  # Checkout the code in the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies  # Install dependencies using pip
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Login to Vercel  # Login to Vercel
        run: |
          vercel login
      - name: Configure Vercel  # Configure Vercel
        run: |
          vercel config
      - name: Build and deploy  # Build and deploy the project using `vercel build` and `vercel deploy`
        run: |
          vercel build
          vercel deploy
```
I added comments before each major section explaining its purpose. I also added inline comments for complex or non-obvious steps, and highlighted any important considerations or gotchas, like the need to replace the API key and secret with actual values.
